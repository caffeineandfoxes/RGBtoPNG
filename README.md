RGBtoPNG
========

A Java program that generates one PNG image file for every RGB color. Takes in a folder path and generates PNG files from each RGB color (thus generating ~16.8 million image files).

This was created with the intention to be used to create swatches in the design phase of programming and have the colors selected be passed to a development team for easy identification of colors and what they should look like in a project.

##Note

This program demands a large amount of system resources, and is recommended to be run when your computer is not needed for several hours. From testing, the program can take as many as five days to run to completion. Your run time will vary if you choose to adjust the file size, as well as the specifications of the computer. If at any point you need to abort the program, you may need to use your operating system's task manager to "kill" the program.
