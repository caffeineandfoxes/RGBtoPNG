RGBtoPNG
========

In the latest publicly available iteration, RGBtoPNG creates a PNG image for every RGB color, a total of ~16.8 million files. It is not recommended that you run this version of the program, as it demands a serious amount of system resources, however for high-powered machines, the potential to run well is debatable, however still not recommended.

The upcoming version of RGBtoPNG will allow users to generate files on an as-requested basis, meaning that users will have to manually choose the colors they want, and generate files one-by-one. This decision has been made to drastically improve performance, and make the program more efficient in terms of function and system resources.
