RGBtoPNG
========

RGBtoPNG comes as an executable JAR, and in its current iteration, allows the user to generate one PNG file per run (an update is coming to allow multiple files/run).

##Use Case
This program was created to give creative workers an easy way to generate imagery depicting colors needed for a project, either to store for oneself or to pass along to a fellow creative for reference.

##Instructions
To generate a PNG image in your color of choice, follow these steps:

1. Use the provided sliders to define the desired red, green, and blue values that make up your color.
2. Ensure the dimensions listed in the text boxes below are as desired. By default, the program generates a 250px x 250px PNG. If these are not as desire, edit the width and height, and select "Set Dimensions".
3. Click the "Start" button.
4. Navigate to the desired output directory using the window that appears, and click "Set Output Directory" when finished.
5. The PNG file will be generated in your specified directory, and the program will close.
